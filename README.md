# Invesitigating-a-medical-dataset-

This project was part of the udactity manodegree program. It contains dataset with information on over hundred thousand medical appointments from Brazil. This dataset was collected from Kaggle and was created to study what factors would be useful in predicting if patients would miss their medical appointments or not. The dataset contains different information about the patients and some of them include their gender, age, neighbourhood, whether or not they rceived SMS notifications, it also shows whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program (scholarship).

Research Questions:
How many patients showed up for their medical appointments?

Does age determine whether or not patients show up for their medical appointments?

Is there any relationship between the gender distribution of the patients and their show ups to medical appointments?

Do Scholarship recipients show up more for their medical appointments?

Do patients who receive SMS notifications show up more for their appointments?
